runanalysis.R:

This script works by taking the working directory of the user, appending the file structure for the Samsung data, and reading
the text files provided into dataframes in R. The data is then combined into one dataset, where all columns describing mean()
and std() are extracted. A new summary dataset of this one is then created and written to the working directory.
